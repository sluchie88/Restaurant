		<p>Restaurant Description</p>
		<p>Tom's Restaurant was founded in July of 2019. While we are still new,
		we are fast becoming a neighborhood staple for our wide selection of foreign 
		and domestic beers (try the nitro stouts, they're Tom's favorite), our unmatched
		pub food, and our frequent events. We have bar trivia every Tuesday and Thursday night,
		hosted by Matt's Trivia. The winning team gets 100 bar dollars and their picture
		on our Facebook page.	So come on down and enjoy a frosty pint, bring some friends for bar trivia, and stick around and chat with
		our friendly staff and patrons. We gurantee you won't be disappointed.</p>
